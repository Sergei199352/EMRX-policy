            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09/04/2024</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of the EMRx Android application ("EMRx", "we", "us", or "our") regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information when you use our application. EMRx is committed to ensuring your privacy is protected and emphasizes that no personal information is collected, recorded, or shared at any point during your use of our application.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>EMRx does not collect or store any personal information from its users.</p>

            <h3>1.1 Device and Permission Data</h3>
            <p><strong>Bluetooth Data:</strong> EMRx requires access to your device's Bluetooth to connect to and communicate with EMRx units. This permission is strictly used for establishing and maintaining connectivity; no personal data is recorded or transmitted.</p>
            <p><strong>Location Permissions:</strong> Due to Android’s operational requirements for accessing Bluetooth, EMRx requests Location permissions from the user. We assure you that EMRx does not use, access, record, or share your location data. This permission is solely for technical compliance required to enable Bluetooth functionalities.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Since EMRx does not collect personal information, there are no practices of using, sharing, or processing user data outside of the essential technical requirements mentioned above.</p>

            <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
            <p>EMRx is designed with a commitment to safeguarding your device’s integrity and operational security. No personal data is collected, hence eliminating concerns regarding data security breaches related to personal information.</p>

            <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. We will inform you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
